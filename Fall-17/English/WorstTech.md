I am biased on this, heavily. The one thing, that actually makes no sense, at least to me, is Facebook (the product, not the company). Facebook was created with the hope of connecting people (and making money) in mind. Then the generation Z came along, and came the era of over-expressivness. Posting, liking, commenting, clicking buttons, pushing keys, scrolling pages, candy crush requests, farmville coins - introverts turning to extroverts, kids finding love, teenage girls making duckfaces and becoming the prom queen the next day because of the one more like than the other girl who didn't pout. We have our personal data poured all over. And this, Facebook, gave birth to more cooler things like Instagram, Snapchat and what not. We became social. Globally. We got addicted.

We now need social validation to have dopamine pouring into our body, we judge our physique by the number of likes we get, we judge ourselves by our physique. We have been enslaved by the "Social" media. It created an illusion right before us, an illusion of a false happiness that's based on a few bytes of data.

While we were busy craving for this "coolness" and "socially updated", we forgot- YOU GET NOTHING FOR FREE.

We became the product that the social media had to sell. Our data is their barter system. Our personal data. Advertisers are the dealers.  And then there's a smart, shady group of uncool nerds sitting in a dark room, or hiding in plain sight is keeping track on us, on the data that we publicized so as to have a social validation and acceptence in our social group. We feed them our data- we get high, they find our pressure points- they stay low. And then came things like Islamic states recruiting future gunmen from facebook, cyber-bullies taking down kids, gamers playing trendy stuff like "Blue whale". People commit suicide, who are we to blame? The curators? No. Us.  We are our worst enemy. The weakest link in the entire network of computers and technology, as most network information security techies would say, the most vulnerable part is the human entity. That's where things start breaking. We fail to realize that. And we keep our likes coming. We don't stop. Why? I am yet to figure that out, humans are complex.I am biased on this, heavily.
