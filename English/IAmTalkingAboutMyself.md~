It was a cold and nice Puja evening in the nursing home in Agartala, Tripura- A small North-Eastern state in India. Intense moment for the man of the family.
The young girl had mixed emotions- "Should I be jealous? Should I be excited?", she thought. Well, very natural of her, as her brother just saw the light of the world and cried his heart out since that warmth, that darkness which was all what knew was taken away from him.
It was October the 23rd in the year 1999, a day before some sort of destruction took place (about which I don't remember and is totally unrelated).
Born prematurely and weak, his parents had full faith in themselves and made sure that their child will survive.
This is the third child to the couple, and the first son who is alive.

He grew up like a normal kid, although tinier than the bunch, liked tweaking things, mostly a loner. Had been denied opportunities for his physique, well, opportunities like being the captain of the "Gali Cricket team".

He comes from a Bengali family based in Tripura, India. His sister, 10 years older than him, is a hidden force behind him which he always hated and loved at the same time. His parents, both government employees- worked hard enough to ensure a future for their children. His father was mostly away due to work, his sister being very older than him, went to college and he spent most of his childhood with his mother. His mother? A very strong woman, who made sure that her overly messy kid doesn't land into some sort of trouble, worked
